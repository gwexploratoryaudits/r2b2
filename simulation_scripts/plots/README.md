## Many plots...
General note: there are some formatting issues and such lingering in some of 
these plots. They are intended to share the information among this team, and 
when certain information is wanted for a paper I can tailor the presentation.

Another note: Please provide any feedback. I'll happily make any changes, 
compute/plot additional data, etc.

### Conditional
The conditional plots consider the probability that an audit stopped
given that it had already made it through to the current round.

### Absolute
The absolute plots consider the probability that an audit stopped.
(So number of audits stopped in a given round divided by the total 
number of audits at the very beginning of the simulation: 10^6 in this case.)

### Ratio
There are also plots of the Minerva ratio for each round which we claim is less
than .1. Clearly in later rounds this doesn't happen; keep in mind that
fewer audits make it into later rounds so these numbers are not as accurate.
(Though in the first round, all are less than .1.)
